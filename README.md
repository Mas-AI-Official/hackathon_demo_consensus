## 🌪️ The Vision
**Daena** is an Autonomous Security Operations Center (ASOC) designed for the next generation of decentralized finance. While Daena is a general-purpose agentic system, its **Web3 and DeFi security capabilities** represent its most critical and advanced application: the ability to detect, debate, and neutralize on-chain threats without human intervention.

In a world where DeFi hacks happen in milliseconds, human governance is too slow. Daena provides **Autonomous Governance**, where a mesh of specialized agents forms a Security Council to protect protocols in real-time.

## 🧠 Core Web3 Capabilities
- **Real-time Threat Neutralization:** Daena monitors smart contracts for reentrancy, overflow, and logic flaws, executing emergency pauses or fund migrations.
- **Multi-Agent Consensus:** Decisions are not made by a single bot, but through a structured debate between "Risk Guards" and "Ops Guards" to ensure safety and correctness.
- **On-chain Audit Trails:** Every action proposed by the agents is backed by a cryptographically signed "Proof of Consensus," making the autonomous logic fully auditable.
- **Self-Healing Proposals:** When a vulnerability is found, Daena doesn't just alert; it generates and proposes optimized security patches for DAO approval.

## 🚀 The Replay Studio
This repository contains the **Interactive Replay Studio**, a high-fidelity demonstration of Daena's consensus engine replaying historical security cycles.

### How to Explore
1.  **Select a Scenario:** Use the "Target Scenario" dropdown to pick from over 120 recorded security runs (from `run_6bc...` logic to complex reentrancy debates).
2.  **Pulse Discovery:** Click **"Pulse"** to step through the agent's thought process or **"One-Click Replay"** to watch the full consensus achieved in real-time.
3.  **Consensus Map:** Observe the dynamic graph as agents communicate across the mesh network to finalize a security decision.
4.  **Security Audit:** Run the **"Consensus Scan"** on the integrated Solidity editor to see how Daena identifies risks internally.
