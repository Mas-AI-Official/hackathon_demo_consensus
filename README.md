## 🌪️ Context: The "DeFi Security" Capability
**Daena is a general-purpose autonomous agent** designed to handle complex workflows across engineering, operations, and governance. She is not limited to security; she is a fully capable AI employee.

This repository demonstrates **just one of her capability modules**: **Autonomous Web3 Security & Consensus**.

In this specific demo, Daena acts as an **Autonomous On-chain Security Operations Center (ASOC)**. She:
1.  **Scans Typescript & Solidity** logic for vulnerabilities.
2.  **Identifies Risks** (e.g., Reentrancy, Logic errors).
3.  **Convenes a Governance Council** of sub-agents to debate the risk.
4.  **Executes Consensus** to approve fixes or pauses, cryptographically signing the decision.

### Why this matters
While Daena can build full-stack apps, manage content pipelines, and handle dev-ops, this demo proves she can handle **high-stakes, trust-critical decision making** using cryptographic consensus.

## 🚀 The Interactive Replay Studio
This site allows you to replay a real autonomous run where Daena secured a DeFi vault.

### Key Features
-   **Multi-Agent Consensus:** Watch the "Risk Guard", "Ops Guard", and "Compliance Guard" debate.
-   **Proof-of-Consensus:** Every action is backed by a cryptographically signed audit trail.
-   **Self-Healing:** Autonomous generation of security governance proposals.
-   **Replay Mode:** Fully offline, static replay of successful security cycles.
